# Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis
This project is focused on customer segmentation using RFM analysis. The main goal of this project is to segment customers based on their transactional behavior and identify valuable segments for targeted marketing campaigns.

# Introduction
RFM analysis is a technique used to segment customers based on their transactional behavior. RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value. Recency refers to the time since a customer's last transaction, Frequency refers to the number of transactions made by a customer, and Monetary value refers to the total amount of money spent by a customer.

By analyzing these three factors, we can identify different segments of customers that exhibit similar transactional behavior. This can be useful for targeted marketing campaigns, as we can tailor our marketing efforts to each segment based on their unique characteristics.

# Machine Learning Model
In this project, we will use a machine learning model to perform customer segmentation using RFM analysis. The input to the model is a dataset of transactional data, and the output is a set of customer segments.

The model is built using a clustering algorithm called K-means clustering. The input to the algorithm is a set of features that describe the transactional behavior of each customer, including recency, frequency, and monetary value. The output is a set of clusters that group together customers with similar transactional behavior.

# Usage
To use this project, simply run the customer_segmentation.py file. This will load the transactional data and perform RFM analysis using K-means clustering. The output will be a set of customer segments that can be used for targeted marketing campaigns.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the use of RFM analysis for customer segmentation. By analyzing the transactional behavior of customers using the RFM framework, we can identify valuable segments for targeted marketing campaigns. The machine learning model built in this project can be used for a variety of applications, including customer segmentation, customer profiling, and customer retention.
