# Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis
This project is focused on customer segmentation using RFM analysis. The main goal of this project is to segment customers based on their transactional behavior and identify valuable segments for targeted marketing campaigns.
# Background
RFM analysis is a commonly used technique for customer segmentation in the field of marketing. The RFM framework is based on the principle that customers who have made recent purchases, have made frequent purchases, and have spent a lot of money are more valuable to a company than customers who have not. By segmenting customers based on their transactional behavior, companies can tailor their marketing efforts to each segment based on their unique characteristics.

# Data Collection
To perform customer segmentation using RFM analysis, we need transactional data for each customer. This data typically includes the following information:

Customer ID: A unique identifier for each customer
Purchase date: The date on which the purchase was made
Purchase amount: The amount of money spent by the customer on the purchase
This data can be collected from a variety of sources, including point-of-sale systems, e-commerce platforms, and customer relationship management (CRM) software.


# Machine Learning Model
In this project, we will use a machine learning model to perform customer segmentation using RFM analysis. The input to the model is a dataset of transactional data, and the output is a set of customer segments.

The model is built using a clustering algorithm called K-means clustering. The input to the algorithm is a set of features that describe the transactional behavior of each customer, including recency, frequency, and monetary value. The output is a set of clusters that group together customers with similar transactional behavior.

# Usage
To use this project, simply run the customer_clustering.ipnyb file. This will load the transactional data and perform RFM analysis using K-means clustering. The output will be a set of customer segments that can be used for targeted marketing campaigns.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the use of RFM analysis for customer segmentation. By analyzing the transactional behavior of customers using the RFM framework, we can identify valuable segments for targeted marketing campaigns. The machine learning model built in this project can be used for a variety of applications, including customer segmentation, customer profiling, and customer retention.
